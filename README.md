# Pokemon-Card-Giveaway
An interface for users to roll for a Pokemon card raffle

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS, CSS, and Mongoose.</p>
<p>The current product utilizes M-V-C based architecture.</p>
<p>Resulting in a simple CRUD app.</p>


<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>Through building this app, I was able to get comfortable with the basics of GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. As well as familiarizing myself in using EJS.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was better able to vizualize and familiarize myself with how these requests are made, throught he use of MVC. </p>
<p>I found that organizing files, introduced some fun new challenges in keeping track of the apps functionalities.</p>

<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>More media queries are needed to make the app fully responsive. Moreover code needs to be refactored to better take advantage of best practices.</p>
<p>Styling aside, adding user authentification is in the works.</p>
